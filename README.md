  </summary>
Stock trading strategies are essential for successful investment, yet developing a profitable approach is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the stock market. This repository introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for automated stock trading that integrates technical and fundamental analyses using a large language model (FinBERT). The experimental results demonstrate superior performance in cumulative return, maximum earning rate, and Sharpe ratio, showing that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods.

## Installation

### Environment Setup

```bash

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment using micromamba or conda:
micromamba create -n lstmppo-drl python=3.9 -y
or
conda create -n lstmppo-drl python=3.9 -y

# Step 2: Activate the virtual environment:
micromamba activate lstmppo-drl
or
conda activate lstmppo-drl
```

# Step 3: Install the required libraries from the requirements file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
Datasets will be added soon. The stock price data is sourced from **Yahoo Finance**, and news data is collected from **Benzinga**. News sentiment analysis will be performed using **FinBERT**.
